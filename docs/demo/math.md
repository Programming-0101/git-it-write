# Mathematical Equations

> $$\Huge E = mc^2$$

There are various tools for generating mathematical equations. One of the first that you may encounter in your search is [**MathJax**](https://www.mathjax.org/). This site uses [**KaTex**](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/), mostly due to its claim of being faster than MathJax when rendering in the browser.

## Demos

**TeX**

> When {% math %}a \ne 0{% endmath %}, there are two solutions to {% math %}(ax^2 + bx + c = 0){% endmath %} and they are {% math %}x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.{% endmath %}

**Shortcut with &dollar;&dollar;**

> When $$ a \ne 0 $$, there are two solutions to $$ (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) $$ and they are $$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$.
