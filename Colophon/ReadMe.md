# My Authoring Journey

As an instructor in software development, I've found it difficult to find good means of creating accessible and useful online content for my students. Between *creating* the content itself (text, images, and graphs) and *maintaining* the content (erratum, new content, and changes in technology and my personal knowlege), there's the challenge of *sharing* the content. I've been on a search for the best ways to do this since the early 2000's.
