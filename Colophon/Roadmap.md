# Roadmap to "Git-IT-Write"

## Proof of Concept

> **Purpose:** To craft a reliable mechanism for creating maintainable content for publishing to the Web.

The desired goals are:

- [ ] Ease of Authoring
  - [x] *Markdown* for plain-text content
  - [x] *Git* for version control
  - [x] *GitHub* for hosting the cloud repository
  - [x] *GitHub Pages* for hosting the static website
  - [ ] Support for *mermaid* diagrams such as *flowcharts*, *sequence diagrams*, *gantt charts*, etc.
  - [ ] Clean content navigation in the code repository (no mis-match between links navigating the repository content and links on the generated static website)
- [ ] Control Over Publishing
  - [ ] Holding content in "draft" form prior to publishing
  - [ ] Control over the site navigation
- [ ] **Extensibility**
  - [ ] Can create custom plug-ins for different types of content
  - [ ] Ease of editing templates (*theming*)
  - [ ] Community plug-ins
- [ ] Longevity
  - [ ] Strong community
  - [ ] Open-source and permissive licenses (commercial and non-commercial) for the toolchain
